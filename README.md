Welcome To The Hentai Diffusion GitHub

Hentai Diffusion has been made to focus not only on hentai, but better hands and better obscure poses.

# Small Study In The Wild

Recently I've released a few images into the wild on different reddit accounts and pages. While most people seem indifferent or unable to tell the difference, a small group of users have been incredibly hostile. No posts were ever removed and it seems the more vocally negative user are an extreme minority, and most users are happy to get more art. The reasons for hostility range from inferioity or jealousy to something more of a precieved justice of "You didn't do that". Though given the vocality of some users 

Seeing as the majority of users enjoy the content, reaching top of a few pages, I feel this experiment was a success, but I do warn against doing this outside of a collecting data. Since no harm was done, nothing was stolen, and overall it was a net gain to the communities as they gained some new art of their favorite characters, is you plan to post art generated by this A.I I reccomend labeling it as such.

Below is one of the most successful examples.

Euler ancestral provides the best results, and doesn't need to be changed.
