## [UI](https://huggingface.co/Deltaadams/ignoremepls/resolve/main/webui-A2.zip) 



## Getting Started:

Step 1:
You'll need a way to run the chkpt file. Check The Downloads for a UI.

Step 2:
Open the folder containing the files you just extracted, and go to this folder.

stable-diffusion-webui-master\models\Stable-diffusion

Place the .chkp file you downloaded into the folder.

Step 3:
Return to the main directory.

stable-diffusion-webui-master\

On windows run webui-user.sh For linux use webui.sh

Let it run and download all the needed requirments. It may seem frozen at times but it is doing fine, just don't close the terminal.

Step 4:
Open your browser to the local address shown in the terminal. It should be something like 127.0.0.1.

Step 5:
Make sure to select Hentai Diffusion (or whatever the currect ckpt file name is) in the dropdown menu here.

Step 6:
Take the negative prompt you downloaded and paste it into the negative prompt section.

Make sure the prompt field above it is empty.


Step 7:
Click the save icon and name it whatever you want. Something like "Master Negative" is a good choice.


Step 8:
Whenever you start up the webui, select style one, and then the name of the master negative. You then click on the clipboard icon and it will add it to the field.

This is only needed once per session and as long as the browser isn't closed.


For best results:
Add "1girl, anime," without the quotes to the beginning of your prompt.



Website Remodel in progress.
The benifits?

Better management and more details for descriptions and guides, direct contact for technical questions, and faster releases. 

Read about our new and upcoming art projects that involve both A.I art and not. We hope everyone enjoys our models, and they will stay free forever.

Addressing the issue involving the fork.
We were made aware of a supply chain issue on the First of January and have been working to address the issue. One of those ways is to move to an official website so that false or malicious files can't be added. We'll be working on a forum on our website in the next couple of months. You can contact us directly on the site.
